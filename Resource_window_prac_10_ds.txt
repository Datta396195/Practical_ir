The scatter plot (Figure 1) shows the relationship between Variable 1 and Variable 2.
We can observe a positive correlation, indicating that as Variable 1 increases, Variable 2 tends to increase as well. However, there is a considerable amount of scatter, suggesting that other factors may influence this relationship.

Scatter Plot

To better understand the distribution of the categorical variable 'category', we created a bar chart (Figure 2). The chart reveals that Category A has the highest frequency, followed by Category B, Category C, and Category D. This information could be useful for further analysis or decision-making processes.

Additionally, we explored the correlation between numerical variables using a heatmap (Figure 3). The heatmap shows that Variable 1 and Variable 2 have a strong positive correlation, confirming the observation from the scatter plot. However, we can also see that Variable 3 has a moderate negative correlation with both Variable 1 and Variable 2, suggesting that it may have an opposing effect on the relationship between the first two variables.

In summary, the visualizations and analysis provide insights into the relationships between variables, the distribution of categories, and the correlations between numerical variables. These findings can be used to inform further analysis, decision-making, or to generate new hypotheses for investigation.
